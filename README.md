# To Do List

This is a project idea from https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list

I had originnaly completed this in JavaScript, my original repo can be found at https://github.com/ajhanson22227/ToDo-List-JS

I wanted to recreate this project using React for the frontend and Express for the backend which can be found at https://github.com/ajhanson22227/ToDo-List-Express.

## Motivation

I wanted to redo this project as a way to further work my knowledge with frontend and backend interactions. After working on the blog project, I wanted to do something else that would work with user accounts and information provided to them. The 'To Do' project seemed like the best way to go.

## Built with

- React
