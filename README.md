# To Do List

This is a project idea from https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list

Originally was done in JavaScript, my original repo can be found at https://github.com/ajhanson22227/ToDo-List-JS

I want to recreate this project using React, and in the future possibly add NodeJS /Express to handle user projects
